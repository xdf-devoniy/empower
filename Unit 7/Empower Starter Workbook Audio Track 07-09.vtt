00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.373
Track 07.09

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:09.052
Paul: Why do we have to go shopping, Sue? It’s so boring.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.496
Sue: You know why, Paul.

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.464
It’s your mum’s birthday on Sunday.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.134
We need to find a present for her.

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:21.992
Paul: That’s easy. I always buy a box of chocolates

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:25.297
and some flowers from that shop near the station.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.679
Sue: Chocolates and flowers?

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:33.770
Those are boring. Let’s get something useful for her new flat.

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.305
Paul: Oh, right. Well,

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.467
let’s try this store here.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.786
They sell lots of nice things.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.517
Sue: OK. Look,

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.440
these cups and plates are nice.

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:50.285
They have pictures of cats on them.

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:53.179
Paul: Mum has a lot of cups.

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:55.653
I don’t think she needs any more.

00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.110
Sue: Well, what about a clock?

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.126
Those clocks over there are nice.

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.565
Or how about a new lamp?

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.193
This one is good for reading

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.529
and your mum loves reading.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.221
Paul: A lamp is a good idea.

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:16.117
I don’t like the colour, though.

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:18.996
Do they have any other colours?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.571
Sue: I don’t think so.

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:23.024
They’re all brown.

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:26.826
Paul: Oh, right ... Hey, do you like

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:29.676
those little red tables over there?

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.260
I know Mum wants a

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:33.860
new table for her laptop.

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:37.031
Sue: Oh, that’s a good idea.

00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:38.704
How much are they?

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:40.763
Paul: £60 each.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:45.047
Sue: OK, let’s get one. And next,

00:01:45.094 --> 00:01:47.197
we need to go to the card shop

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.353
and choose a birthday card.
