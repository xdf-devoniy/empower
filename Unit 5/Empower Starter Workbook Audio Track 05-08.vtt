Track 05.08

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:05.909
Receptionist: Good morning.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.227
Can I help?

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:08.373
Harry: Hi.

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.270
I’d like a hotel room for the weekend.

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:12.598
Receptionist: Well,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.566
there are a lot of different hotels

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:18.554
and they have different prices.

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:21.461
Harry: I’d like a room for one person

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:22.651
near the beach.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.381
Receptionist: Hmm, it’s summer

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:29.867
and there aren’t a lot of free rooms.

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:33.715
The Hotel Casa is near the beach.

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:40.624
They have rooms with baths for $160 a day

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:48.957
and breakfast is free. The rooms have TVs and free wi-fi,

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:52.577
and there’s a good restaurant in the hotel.

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:55.234
Harry: It’s very expensive

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.329
and I don’t have a lot of money.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.539
Receptionist: Well, there’s the City Hostel

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.234
near the station. The rooms are small,

00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:06.870
but they’re clean

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:09.600
and a room for one person

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:11.978
is only $40.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.628
Harry: That’s cheap.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.914
Receptionist: Yes, it is.

00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:19.509
There are showers in all the rooms

00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:23.382
and wi-fi in the café on the ground floor,

00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:26.509
but you have to pay for the wi-fi.

00:01:26.763 --> 00:01:29.572
A lot of backpackers stay there

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:31.679
and it’s very friendly.

00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:34.219
Harry: Is there a restaurant?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.679
Receptionist: No, there isn’t.

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:39.575
But there’s a café and there are

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.351
two supermarkets near the hostel.

00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:43.864
Harry: OK.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.697
Receptionist: Do you want me

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.154
to phone the hostel?

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.232
Harry: Yes, please.
