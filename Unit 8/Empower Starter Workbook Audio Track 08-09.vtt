Track 08.09

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:05.441
Grace: Morning, Matt.

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:07.615
How was your weekend?

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.440
Matt: It was good, thanks, Grace.

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:12.953
My wife was at work on Saturday,

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:15.156
so I was at home with the children.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.141
I think they were a bit bored.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:22.240
But we went to a concert in the park yeasterday. There were a lot of people.

00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:25.053
Grace: Really? How was the concert?

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:28.317
Matt: It was fun. The bands were very good.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.228
Grace: Was it expensive?

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.540
Matt: Well, that was the best thing.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.022
A family ticket was only £10.00!

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.333
We had a great day.

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.002
There was a lot to see and do.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.737
Anyway, how was your weekend?

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:43.997
Grace: Oh, it was good.

00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:45.979
I was in Barcelona.

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:46.883
Matt: Wow!

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:49.314
Was it your first visit to Barcelona?

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:49.989
Grace: No,

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:52.509
my sister moved there four years ago

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:53.946
and I often visit her.

00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:55.265
Matt: Was it hot?

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:56.912
Grace: It wasn’t hot,

00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.174
but it wasn’t very cold either.

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:01.267
On Saturday,

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:03.718
we went to a restaurant on the beach.

00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:05.968
We had a lovely meal there,

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:07.694
but the restaurant was empty!

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.045
There weren’t any other people.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.664
Matt: What did you do yesterday?

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:15.224
Grace: We went to the National Museum.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.486
It was really interesting.

00:01:17.772 --> 00:01:19.965
We saw so many things.

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:21.646
Matt: How much was it?

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:26.964
Grace: It was free. You don’t have to pay to go into some museums on Sunday.
