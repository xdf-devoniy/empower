Track 08.01

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:06.460
A: You weren’t here on Friday afternoon.

00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:08.222
Where were you?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.079
B: I was with my brothers.

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:12.143
We were at a basketball game.

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:14.650
A: Oh, was it good?

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:17.787
B: No, it wasn’t. I don’t like basketball.

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:18.619
A: Oh.

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:21.652
And where were you on Friday evening?

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:23.286
B: We were at a party.

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:25.302
A: Was it a good party?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.865
B: It was OK. The people were really nice,

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:30.913
but the music wasn’t very good.
