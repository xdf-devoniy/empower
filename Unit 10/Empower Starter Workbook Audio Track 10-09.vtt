00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:02.151
Track 10.09

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:04.813
Jack: Hi, Mum.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:06.370
Mum: Hello, Jack.

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:08.275
Is Dad home yet?

00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:10.994
Jack: No, there’s no one here except me.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.875
Dad phoned from his office

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.121
half an hour ago.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.355
There’s a problem so he’s working late.

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:18.421
Mum: What are you doing?

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:20.161
I can hear music.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.876
Are you watching TV?

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.840
Jack: No, I’m listening to music and getting ready to go out to the cinema.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.772
Mum: And where’s Melinda?

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:31.805
Jack: She’s at the sports centre with some of her friends.

00:00:32.114 --> 00:00:33.805
I think they’re playing tennis.

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:35.235
What about you?

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:37.943
Mum: I’m at the station with your brother.

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:40.120
We’re waiting for the train,

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.392
but there’s a problem.

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:42.584
Jack: What do you mean?

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:46.214
Mum: Well, the train is late and it’s starting to snow now.

00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:47.367
Jack: Oh, no!

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.234
Mum: Tim isn’t very happy.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.934
He’s only wearing his jeans and a jumper.

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:53.793
He didn’t want to put his coat on

00:00:53.794 --> 00:00:54.986
when we left the house.

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:56.606
Jack: Can I talk to him?

00:00:56.943 --> 00:00:57.558
Mum: Not now.

00:00:58.283 --> 00:00:59.446
He’s in the café.

00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:01.685
He’s buying some hot drinks for us.

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.022
Jack: Oh, right.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.516
Mum: Oh, I’ve got to go! The train is arriving.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.392
There are lots of people here on the

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:09.846
platform and it’s going to be

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:11.372
difficult to get a seat.

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:14.773
Tim! Tim! Hurry up!
