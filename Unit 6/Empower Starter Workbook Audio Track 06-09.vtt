Track 06.09

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:05.587
Presenter: Welcome to the show.

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:09.142
This week we’re talking to people who live

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:10.561
and work in Scotland.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:15.352
Today, my guest is 44-year-old Ian Baker.

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:18.590
Which part of Scotland are you from, Ian?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.832
Ian: I’m from a village near Aberdeen.

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:22.443
Presenter: And what do you do?

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:24.511
Ian: Well, I’m a businessman.

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.673
My wife Rita and I have a factory in Aberdeen.

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:28.903
Presenter: That’s interesting.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.067
How many people work there?

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:32.933
Ian: We have 90 workers.

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:34.380
Presenter: And what do you make?

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:36.098
Ian: Computers for schools.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.759
Presenter: Do you like your work?

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:40.894
Ian: Yes, I do. I work long hours.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.281
I start at 7 or 8 in the morning and

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:45.146
finish at 7 or 8 in the evening.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.361
But my job is never boring.

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.834
I’m not in my office every day.

00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:51.657
I go to different places

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.536
and I meet a lot of people,

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:55.422
for example, the teachers

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.288
and children who use our computers.

00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:00.308
Presenter: Are all your customers here in the UK?

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:02.462
Ian: No, some customers are here, but

00:01:02.493 --> 00:01:05.430
schools in South America also buy our computers,

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:08.145
so I often fly to Brazil for meetings.

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.589
Presenter: Are your meetings in English?

00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.564
Ian: Sometimes,

00:01:11.812 --> 00:01:14.054
but we usually speak in Portuguese.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:15.706
Presenter: Does your wife go with you?

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:17.511
Ian: No, she works with our

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:18.792
customers in the UK

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:20.174
and the rest of Europe.

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:22.700
Presenter: And how often do you ...
