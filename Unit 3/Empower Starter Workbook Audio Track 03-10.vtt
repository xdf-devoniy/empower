00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:05.548
Anna: What do you want, John?

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.480
John: A sandwich.

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:09.980
What sandwiches do they have?

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.706
Anna: They have cheese.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.206
John: Oh, I never eat cheese.

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:15.198
I don’t like it.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.293
Anna: Really? Do you like eggs?

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:20.555
John: Oh yes. I like eggs.

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:22.142
Anna: And tomatoes?

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:24.722
John: Yes, I eat a lot of tomatoes.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.713
Anna: OK.

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:28.630
They have egg and tomato sandwiches.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.059
I like those.

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:31.020
John: Great.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.175
So, two egg and tomato sandwiches.

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:36.203
Anna: Do they have any cake?

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:41.381
John: Yes, they have chocolate cake or apple pie with ice cream.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.250
Anna: Well, I don’t eat a lot of chocolate,

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.512
but I like chocolate cake.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:50.410
John: Me too. And to drink?

00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:54.339
Tea or coffee? I usually drink tea.

00:00:54.498 --> 00:00:56.502
Anna: I don’t like hot drinks.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.406
Do they have fruit juice?

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.660
John: Yes, apple juice or orange juice.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.956
Anna: Oh, apple juice.

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:06.734
I always have orange juice for breakfast.

00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:08.956
John: OK. Excuse me ...
