Track 12.11

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.606
Marta: Hi, Lucas. Can you hear me?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.467
Lucas: Hi, Marta.

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:12.365
Yes, I can see you and hear you.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.883
Where are you now?

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:17.751
Marta: I’m in Los Angeles for three days.

00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.682
I took the bus from San Diego yesterday.

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:24.204
Lucas: What are you going to do there?

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:28.381
Marta: Well, today after breakfast,

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:31.590
I’m going to visit a film studio

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:35.054
and go shopping in Rodeo Drive.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.117
Lucas: Wow! Rodeo Drive is expensive.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.905
Marta: I just want to look around.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.105
Maybe I’ll see someone famous!

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.878
What about you?

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:49.264
Lucas: It’s not raining here,

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.265
so I’m going to take the dog for a walk.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.315
Then I’m going to have dinner and read a book.

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:58.018
Marta: What about Mum and Dad?

00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:00.091
Are they at home with you?

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:03.421
Lucas: Mum’s here, but she’s in the shower.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.223
She’s going to meet some friends later

00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:07.765
and go to the cinema.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.625
Dad went out a few minutes ago.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.508
He’s going to play tennis with Uncle Raffa.

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:15.394
Marta: Oh, right.

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:18.859
Lucas: Anyway, tell me the rest of your plans.

00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:21.615
Marta: Well, tomorrow morning

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.012
I’m going to go to the beach

00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:29.978
and in the afternoon I have a ticket for an American football game.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.220
But Thursday is the best day.

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:36.771
I’m going to spend the day at Disneyland!

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:40.087
Lucas: Wow! That sounds fantastic.

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:43.995
Marta: It is – America is great!

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:46.576
After Los Angeles,

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:50.230
I’m going to take a bus to Las Vegas,

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:54.870
and after that, Dallas and New Orleans.

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:57.263
Lucas: Well, have a good time.

00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:02.742
Marta: Thanks, Lucas. Tell Mum and Dad I’ll phone them tomorrow.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:03.921
Lucas: Will do!

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:05.867
They’ll be happy to hear from you.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:06.994
Bye!

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:08.065
Marta: Bye!
