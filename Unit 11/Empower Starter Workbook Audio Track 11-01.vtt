Track 11.01

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:06.615
A: I’ve got some photos of the party.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.227
They’re very funny.

00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:10.849
B: Oh, can I see them?

00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:13.352
A: Yes, just a minute … OK …

00:00:13.377 --> 00:00:15.481
My brother’s in this picture.

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:17.006
He arrived really late.

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:18.133
B: Really?

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:19.541
Where is he?

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.082
I can’t see him!

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.203
A: He’s there, with the blue hat!

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:26.230
B: Oh yes!

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.859
It’s a very big hat!

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.790
Is that you?

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:32.466
It’s your T-shirt.

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.017
A: Yes, that’s me.

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:36.383
I’m with Ian and Debbie.

00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:37.965
They’re really nice.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:39.800
B: And who’s that?

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:42.144
A: That’s Anna-Maria.

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:43.884
She’s at our house now.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.203
She’s staying with us.

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:46.752
B: Can I meet her?

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:48.325
A: Yes, of course.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.849
She really wants to meet you!
