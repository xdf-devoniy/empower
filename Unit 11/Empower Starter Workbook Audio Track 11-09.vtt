00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:02.444
Track 11.09

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.925
Alex: What are you doing, Camila?

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.800
Camila: Hi Alex. I’m working.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:14.354
Alex: You’re looking at job websites!

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.079
I hope your manager doesn’t see you.

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:19.659
Camila: He isn’t in the office.

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:22.853
Alex: Good! Let me see the website.

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:24.688
Look!

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:28.152
There’s a job for a singer on a ship …

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:30.400
but you can’t sing.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:34.579
Oh, and there’s a job for a chef

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.241
on the same ship.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.600
You’re a fantastic cook.

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:41.769
Camila: Just one small problem.

00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:46.575
I can’t swim so I don’t want to work on a boat.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.223
Alex: Well, what about this job as an

00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:52.868
English teacher in Mexico?

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:57.064
You speak Spanish and you love travelling.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.813
Camila: But I can’t teach

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:03.967
and I don’t want to live in a really hot country.

00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:05.955
Alex: Oh, right.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:10.109
Well, an IT company in Manchester

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:11.808
wants a receptionist.

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:16.210
Camila: I don’t want to work in another office.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.666
Alex: How about this job as a tour guide?

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:23.527
You take people on bus tours around York.

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:27.136
Camila: Hmm ... Sounds interesting.

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.947
What do they want?

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:32.886
Alex: Someone who knows a lot about York

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.658
and who can speak English

00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:37.487
and another language.

00:01:37.512 --> 00:01:40.546
Camila: Well I was born in York,

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.389
so I know a lot about it,

00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:46.194
but I can’t drive.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.428
Alex: You don’t drive the bus.

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:52.160
You just talk to the passengers.

00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:54.331
Camila: Oh, right.

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:57.365
Well, that sounds interesting.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.369
I’ll phone the tour company this afternoon!

00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:03.682
Alex: Shhh! Your manager’s coming back.
