Narrator: Conversation 1

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:06.883
A: What do you think of this room?

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:11.061
B: I don’t think grey is a good idea for the walls.

00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:13.200
A: Maybe you’re right.

00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:16.543
But I think it’s OK with the red bed.

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:18.506
B: I’m not so sure.

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.652
B: It was terrible!

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:28.551
C: Yes, I agree.

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:30.813
It’s a really bad film!

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:31.758
A: Really?

00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:33.244
I don’t think so.

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.492
I liked it.
