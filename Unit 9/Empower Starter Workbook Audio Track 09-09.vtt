Track 09.09

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:07.003
Researcher: Excuse me, sir.

00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:10.733
Do you have time to answer a holiday questionnaire?

00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:13.433
Man in Street: Er, yes. OK.

00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:15.311
Researcher: Thank you. Right,

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.262
my first question is:

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:19.609
When was your last holiday?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.804
Man in Street: Oh, in autumn.

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:24.341
We usually go on holiday in summer,

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:26.093
but this year we went in autumn.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:28.031
Researcher: Did you stay in the UK

00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:30.074
or did you go to another country?

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:32.989
Man in Street: I went to Faro in Portugal with my wife.

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:36.037
The children didn’t want to come, so they stayed at home.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:37.922
Researcher: How did you get there?

00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:39.913
Man in Street: Well my wife doesn’t like

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:41.672
flying, so we went by ship

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:45.077
from England to Spain, then we took a train to Faro.

00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:47.049
Researcher: How long was your holiday?

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:48.007
Man in Street: Three weeks.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.839
Researcher: Did you stay in a hotel?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.678
Man in Street: No, we didn’t.

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.967
One of our friends has a house near the beach and we stayed there.

00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:58.078
It was our second holiday there.

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:00.408
Researcher: Do you speak Portuguese?

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:04.257
Man in Street: No, but I learned a few phrases before we left England.

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:07.273
Researcher: Why didn’t you stay in the UK for your holiday?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.598
Man in Street: Because Portugal has better weather! England is often

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.442
cold and rainy in autumn.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:14.269
Researcher: OK,

00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:16.929
and my next question is...
